# Sublime ViewBookmarks

A simple plugin that adds 'view all boookmarks' functionality—and the ability to jump to the listed bookmarks—to the `Goto > Bookmarks` menu and the Command Pallet.

The functionality integrates seamlessly with the native bookmark features.

(This package was forked from [LSBookmarks](https://github.com/ibensw/LsBookmarks) and modified to integrate better with native functionality.)
